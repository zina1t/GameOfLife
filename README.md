# Simple version of Conway's Game Of Life
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Rules
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

##    Graphics

Treat the playing field - a rectangle of 80 by 25 cells â€“ as a matrix of the state of the "game".
It is assumed that the field is "closed to itself", for example, in the lower right square, the neighbor on the right is the lower left square, and the neighbor on the bottom is the upper right.
Provide for original initialization of the "game" state via stdin. Prepare at least 5 files with initial states for quick launch and initialization through input redirection.
